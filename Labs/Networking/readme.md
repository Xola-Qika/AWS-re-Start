# Networking Lab: Build Your VPC and Launch a Web Server

## Objective
Create VPC, subnets, configure security groups and launch an EC2 instance into a VPC

## Tasks 
- Create your VPC
- Create additional subnets
- Associate subnets and add routes
- Create a VPC security group
- Launch a web server instance
